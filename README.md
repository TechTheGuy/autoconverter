# autoconverter
Decimal to binary converter written in python to make it professor feels shamed of her self.Execute this code with any version of python. I hope my classmates will use this. If she discovers, who cares! im just a guy who loves programming!
Base_multipla is buggy so use trova one
APPARENTLY  she really likes leaving us a ton of homework, so im already starting to implement binary operations in this program.
IM NOT ENCOURAGING ANYONE TO NOT DO THEYR HOMEWORK, BUT BECAUSE I DO THIS STUFF FROMM WHEN I WAS 8 I CAN PERMIT THIS TO MYSELF BECAUSE I KNOW THEESE THINGS REALLY (TOO) WELL.
